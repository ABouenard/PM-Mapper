Technology is changing so fast that this activity could be never-ending, so you should set a reasonable limit for solution development.  This limit is usually set by corporate need.  If the corporation is heading toward a major performance crisis (in a year) because of the current infrastructure, technology and solution research must end early enough for solution development, testing, and deployment to be complete before the crisis point is reached.\n\nThe intent of this milestone is to provide the endpoint of this section of research. Set it appropriately."
